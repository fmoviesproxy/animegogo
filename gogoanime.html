<h1>Why are Anime Characters so stupid - Anime Gogo</h1>
<p>A familiar question is: &ldquo;Why are they so stupid?&rdquo; usually refers to the main characters of a shounen manga or anime. Some of the names that pop into our heads are Naruto, Luffy, Ichigo and Goku in the popular anime series on <a href="https://gogoanime.studio/">Anime Gogo</a>. To answer this question, we should realize that the stereotype of characters who don't have the intelligence of a normal person is for the shounen protagonist, which is different from the goofy character used in comedy.</p>
<p>In comedies, characters are sillyly contrived to make comical mistakes, making us laugh, which is not the same as the lack of intelligence portrayed by shounen manga. Many people think that this is so that the work can send the message that being a hero, you are not necessarily smarter than people, and strength is more important than intelligence.</p>
<p>Usually, shounen manga protagonists have courage, courage, strength, willpower or similar qualities to make up for their lack of intelligence. The question here is&hellip; why? What makes us value strength over wisdom? Why is Luffy being praised for the way he always moves toward his dreams without anyone complaining about how stupid he is?</p>
<p>The answer seems obvious, because no one wants to praise a fool, or in other words, we see the situation that each person has a different weakness. And now the question becomes, what if Luffy is a character that is both strong and intelligent?</p>
<p>Then, how will I change the way I see you? A character like that that we know for sure is Deku, inheriting the power of One for All, and at the same time very intelligent, good at analyzing and judging situations. Mentally and physically, Deku not only dreams of becoming a hero, but he has a clear path on how to train himself to become one. Watch free anime at <a href="https://gogoanime.studio/">https://gogoanime.studio/</a>.</p>
<p>Why aren't there more heroes like Deku in shounen anime? If these powerful and intelligent characters can not only be successful, but also get success (look at the huge success of Super Hero Academy), why is Boruto just as stupid as his father? The answer is: Demographics.</p>
<p>The audience for shounen anime in the US and Japan is usually teenage boys or teenagers, and anime, like any other entertainment industry, thrives on viewership. When analyzing why the character Goku has strength but a dark mind, we must also consider the audience of the anime.</p>
<p>Question &ldquo;Why do boys and teenagers like to watch shounen anime?&rdquo; More analysis is needed on how shounen anime has many male characters, the difference between men and women, and how this difference affects viewers, but we won't discuss that here.</p>
<p>Instead, the answer to the obscurity of many shounen anime characters will be based on a simple psychological rule: A teenage boy admires a shounen anime protagonist because the character is easy to them. understand. We should go deeper into the viewer's psychology, based on two main factors: the experience of being immersed in the movie and the escape from reality.</p>
<p>The average teenage male will understand Goku on many levels because of the character's ease of understanding. We see most clearly in Goku the strength, courage, the will to always look forward, and the kindness. Of course characters are more complicated but these are the main points when we think about characters.</p>
<p>A typical teenager finds these traits easy to understand and also easy to imitate, making it easy to see yourself in the viewer's character. Viewers do not need to change too much to become Goku. It is worth noting that in order for the viewer to immerse himself in the character, the character must be easy to understand and imitate, hardly needing to change too much from the viewer himself in real life. Change as little as possible, and this leads to the main point of the article.</p>
<p>The experience of being immersed in the movie and escaping from reality is what a teenager looks for in anime, a door that helps them escape from the boring reality of everyday life. Even after the anime ends, viewers can still imagine and imitate the characters they admire.</p>
<p>The easier the character is to understand and imitate, the longer the fantasy lasts. Naruto is such a typical character; At first he was a loser, a troublemaker, had no friends, was nowhere to be found, and had no relationships. To be Naruto or someone like Naruto doesn't require much effort, rather any effort at all.</p>
